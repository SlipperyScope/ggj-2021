Did the DM send you down here to clean up the place? Finally. How am I supposed to get my groove on with all these corpses lying around? Really harshes the vibe, man. Hey now listen - if you’re new around here, I’ve got a tip for ya’. I saw the hero come by, lookin’ all fly, he walked right into that cold room nearby. And when he left he had that super sick shield. Anyway, I hope that helps. I’ll catch you on the flipside, my groovy dude!"
